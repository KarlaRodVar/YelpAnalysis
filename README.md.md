**Project Objectives and stages of the project:**

- Create a Machine Learning Algorithm to identify possible business insigts based on different information related to the businesses, the reviews assigned by users and the different types of users from a dataset extracted from an open datasource of Yelp page. Primarly focus on generating an algorithm of review star classification and users classifications.

- Frist Part of the Project: Import a high volume of data and execute EDA.
- Second Part of the Project: Create a supervise algorithm to predict review star based on texts.
- Third Part of the Project: Optimization of the best model created. 
- Fourth Part of the Project: Interpretability and Explainability of the Model.
- Fifth Part of the Project: Creation of an unsupervise algorithm to clusterize the users.
